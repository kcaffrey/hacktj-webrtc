## Prerequisites

- NodeJS (tested with v18.12.1)

## Running the server

First install node modules with the following command:

    npm install

Next start the web server locally by invoking:

    npm run server

Open multiple browser tabs to http://localhost:8999 and you should see multiple copies of yourself!
